        <p id="page-description"><strong>The Big O</strong> (THE ビッグオー Tha Biggu Ō) is an anime series directed by <strong>Kazuyoshi Katayama</strong> and animated by the Japanese animation studio <strong>Sunrise</strong>. The first season of the series premiered on October 13, 1999 on WOWOW with the episode <em>"Roger the Negotiator"</em> and concluded with <em>"R.D."</em> on January 19, 2000. Starting on April 2, 2001, The Big O aired two times in its edited form on the <strong>Cartoon Network</strong>: once during the afternoon <strong>Toonami</strong> block at 5:30 PM, and once at 12:30 AM during Toonami: Midnight Run; the 12:30 AM showing was the premiere and the more publicized 5:30 PM showing a rerun. In anticipation of the premiere of The Big O: Season Two, the first thirteen episodes were re-aired, completely uncut, on the <strong>Adult Swim</strong> block. Originally a 26-episode series, it was reduced to 13 episodes due to low ratings in Japan. However, positive international reception resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and <strong>Bandai Visual</strong>. The Big O: Season Two premiered on 2 January 2003 on SUN-TV with the episode <em>"Roger the Wanderer"</em> and concluded with <em>"The Show Must Go On"</em> on March 27, 2003. The American premiere took place on August 3, 2003.</p>
