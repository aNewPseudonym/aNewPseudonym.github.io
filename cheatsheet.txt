Cheatsheet
To test stuff locally (new plugin, theme, how a new blog post looks):

Start local site: Type bundle exec jekyll serve --watch at the command line
Visit local site: Open localhost:4000/yourwebfoldername/ in a web browser (e.g. localhost:4000/JekyllDemo/). 
    Don’t forget the trailing slash!
See changes on the local site as you make them: While the site is running, after making changes to website files: 
    save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes—except for the _config.yml file, 
    for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.
Stop local site: Hit control-c on the command line.


To move local changes to your live site (new post, settings tweak, etc.):

Make the desired changes to your website’s local files.
Open the GitHub Desktop app, and write your commit message summary (and description if desired).
Click “Commit to gh-pages” in the lower left.
After the commit has completed, click “Sync” in the upper right.
Allow 10-90 seconds for your changes to reach GitHub’s web servers.
