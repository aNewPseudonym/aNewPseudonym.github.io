- Fatale (2009)
    - legend/mythological storytelling, imbued with contemporary artifacts
    - broken into 3 parts with no pressures or defined goals or failure states - just exist, explore, experience the story
    - interesting movement system(s)
    - curious as a game, feels weighed down by having to tell an established story? does it add anything to the canon of Salome?
- Bientôt l'été (2012)
    - a profoundly lonely experience, an experimental multiplayer game about communication with no one to talk to
