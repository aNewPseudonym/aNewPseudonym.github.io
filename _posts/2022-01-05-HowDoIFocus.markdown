Dear Diary,

I like how fighting games force me to focus.

I've developed a small routine when preparing to play Guilty Gear. 

First, I make sure I have nothing else pressing that I need to do. Guilty Gear is something I do for fun secondarily to other parts of my life. I don't GG to be a drain on my life, and I also don't want my GG play to suffer because I'm distracted by other things that need my attention more. So, if there are emails or dishes or social obligations that require my attention, I attend to that first. If it turns out that I don't actually have the time or bandwidth for GG today, it's better in the long term to leave it for another day.

Next, I make sure my environment is clean and free of distractions. I play on my computer at the same desk I do a lot of other work, so I make sure I've cleared it of any lingering remnants of those other uses. I close all windows and tabs that aren't relevant, and I clear my desk of irrelevant trash, papers, or other distractions. I've taken to lighting candles as well. It's calming, and helps make the space of my room feel different. Like an indicator to some subconscious level of my brain that it's time to focus on one thing.

After that, I make sure I have my bodily needs attended to. I use the bathroom. I make sure I have something to drink, namely, a full water bottle and usually a cup of hot tea. If I want it, I keep a small snack on hand, often times some small candies or crackers. I make sure my chair is at a comfortable height and distance from the screen.

When all of that is done, I turn on the game.

I am really bad at focusing in many areas of my life.

I have millennial brain. If I'm not receiving active stimulation from multiple sources at any given point in time, my brain starts to grind against itself.

During a summer spent interning in Rio de Janeiro, I had no cell phone service on my iPhone for an extended period of time for the first time in years. I mainly walked to work or took the subway, both of which were a reasonable 30-40 minute commute at most. And yet I always took care to ensure I had something to look at or listen to on my phone whenever I left my house or work. I downloaded podcasts or videos, or loaded up articles to ensure I wouldn't be without mental stimulation for the brief trip in between wifi connections. If I didn't, I would have to be alone with my own thoughts, and that low-key terrified me. 

That behavior was definitely in no small part a result of me being an lonely, insecure, young man in a foreign city, but it's an issue that has followed me for a lot of my life. I think many people, certainly many other people around my age, struggle with this to some degree.

Pressure or deadlines, from work or school, can force me to focus when necessary, but for stuff that isn't strictly necessary is where this problem starts negatively affecting me. I've felt my ability to actively pursue my hobbies gradually decrease over the years. I've had a passion for art since a young age. In middle school and high school, I drew all the time. It was rarely a chore. But as I've gotten older, maintaining that hobby has gotten harder. There are surely a multitude of reasons for that, but the one I feel strongly is a constant pull on my attention when I sit down to have dedicated drawing time. There's always something pulling my focus away. Easier recreation activities, like just watching YouTube or scrolling social media, are always tempting me. Living in an age of infinite content capable of being beamed into my ears and eyes at nearly any time and place make it more than a little hard to focus on the present. Adult responsibilities are another big aspect to this - there's frequently work or school stuff on my mind, or life upkeep tasks like dishes or laundry filling up my time. Even less taxing hobbies like reading or playing videogames or watching movies can seem like a tough commitment at times.

And that can feel really bad! I know I want to do all those things. I found them fun and easy at some point in my life, but now I'm being blocked from accessing that enjoyment and fulfillment. It makes me feel lazy, like my inability to focus is the result of some moral failing.

Trying to get good at Guilty Gear recently has illuminated some strategies for combatting this problem.
