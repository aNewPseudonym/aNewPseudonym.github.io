Haven't had too much time to play as the semester has gotten rolling.

Messed around with Baiken for a bit when she released, playing against Lanxeared and Weather Report, but she doesn't really suit me. Too slow, awkward pokes, not enough cool tether stuff yet.

I rematched Lanxeared's I-No a few weeks back, and played some of the best Gio of my life. Check out the tapes.

Interested in trying to learn Faust. Was playing him a bit yesterday and he's a lot of fun. The long pokes and kooky zoning is a blast. Fun second to Gio maybe.
