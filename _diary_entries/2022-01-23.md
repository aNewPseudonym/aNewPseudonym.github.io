Reviewing the tapes against Lanxeared's I-no.

The first two games honestly weren't terrible i guess. I can't block for shit, but i was finding a few openings, kinda close, got a round.

But then I got increasingly scared and focused on blocking right instead of escaping or challenging. More 5p mash would have helped, instead of 2k or whatever the fuck I was doing. Trying to Sol Nascente in some more situations would have helped too, the pay off from that is huge. Just anything to make I-no's life harder and not cycle through the same options again and again.

My bursts were so damn bad from the jump though, like ffffuuuuck. Honestly embarrassing, even as it was happening.

My own pressure needs work to. Focusing on spacing would help, by trying to end block strings at a further distance. A long range Sepultura or 5H can't be punished and gives me a lot of options after. Or, more trying to close the gap to start c.S pressure.
