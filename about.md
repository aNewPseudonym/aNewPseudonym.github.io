My name is Fran Di Caprio and this is my personal website. I'm an architectural designer based out of the Twin Cities.

I tend to overthink things. Thoughts on movies, videogames, and books get stuck in my head, so I write about them to get them unstuck, and put the results here on my blog. I'm currently working on a series of posts about Walking Simulators, a videogame genre I find fascinating. Check back in for updates on that.

I recently updated my online portfolio with my latest architecture and graphic design work. Check that out over at [work.frdicapr.io](work.frdicapr.io).

If for any reason you want to contact me, hit me up at: *frdicaprio01@gmail.com.* Otherwise, check out any of my social links in the footer. Thank you for visiting.
