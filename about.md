My name is Fran Di Caprio and this is my personal website. I'm a grad student in the Twin Cities working on my Masters of Architecture.

I tend to overthink things. Thoughts on movies, videogames, and books get stuck in my head, so I write about them to get them unstuck, and put the results here. I am intermittently working on a series of posts about Walking Simulators, a videogame genre I find fascinating. I also occasionally update an online [diary](https://frdicapr.io/diary/) of my efforts to improve at fighting games.

I am actively updating my online portfolio with my latest architecture work. Check that out over at [work.frdicapr.io](work.frdicapr.io).

If you want to contact me, email me at: *frdicaprio01@gmail.com.* Otherwise, check out any of my social links in the footer. Thanks for visiting.
