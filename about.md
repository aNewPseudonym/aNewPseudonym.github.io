My name is Fran Di Caprio. I'm an architectural designer based out of the Twin Cities. I sometimes refer to myself as ANEW.

I tend to overthink things. Thoughts on movies, videogames, and books get stuck in my head. So I write about them to get them unstuck, and put the results here to see if anyone else is interested.

I'm currently working on a series of posts about Walking Simulators, a videogame genre I find fascinating. Check back in for updates on that.

If for some reason you want to contact me, hit me up at: *frdicaprio01@gmail.com.*
