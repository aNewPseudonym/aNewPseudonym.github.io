My name is Fran Di Caprio and this is my personal website. I'm an architectural designer based out of the Twin Cities.

I tend to overthink things. Thoughts on movies, videogames, and books get stuck in my head, so I write about them to get them unstuck, and put the results here on my blog. I'm currently working on a series of posts about Walking Simulators, a videogame genre I find fascinating. Check back in for updates on that.

I'm also in the process of filling out my new online portfolio with design work from the past several years. Please be excited.

If for any reason you want to contact me, hit me up at: *frdicaprio01@gmail.com.*
