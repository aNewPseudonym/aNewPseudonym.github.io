Outline:

## The narrative experiment
- What is it
    - made by thechineseroom (now known as The Chinese Room)
    - June 2008 free Half-Life 2 mod
    - remade for full release in February 2012
    - rereleased again as a Unity engine game in 2017, functionally the same as the 2012 version
- How it works
    - randomized story voiceover triggers, plus some other elements
    - describe play etc etc etc
        - slow pace critical
    - Ambiguity is the point
        - several words, ideas, and images are repeated in different contexts, allowing you to draw connections and piece together a story
    - From commentary: Does have a gameplay loop! Bursts of engagement, each one targeting an overall mood
    - "Dreamlike words" - actively moving away from the directness/literalness of videogame worlds
        - not meant to be too literal - source of the title and opening line as a song lyric that caught Dan Pinchbeck's ear indicates that

> Oh, really? \\
> Don't come back \\
> Stay out! \\
> **Dear Esther...** \\
> Okay, come back. \\
> I didn't mean it. \\
> I said I was only kidding. \\
> **Come back** \\
> I didn't mean it

- What I gathered, in my playthroughs
    - There are 4 named characters: Esther, of course, Paul, Donnelly, and Jacobson
    - There is also the Narrator, who may be one of the named characters, specifically Paul.
    - Esther is the deceased wife of the Narrator, who died in a car crash. We get scant few details on her, beyond the nature of her death and the circumstances of her birth.
    - Paul was the driver of one of the cars involved in the accident, perhaps the one Esther was in, or perhaps the other. Whether he had or had not been drinking alcohol the night of the accident is lingering question in the mind of the Narrator.
    - Donnelly was the writer from the 1700s that visited the island on which the game takes place. In his book "A Hebridean History," he wrote on its inhabitants, miserable god-fearing sheperds mostly, as well as tales of an old hermit, and also Jacobson.
    - Jacobson was one of the first settlers of the island. He built a 'bothy,' a small hut, on the island, hoping to acquire enough land and good-standing to marry. He died only 2 years after completing it, from one illness or another. In his dying hours, he attempted to scale the island's cliff. His body froze, referred to as curling into a stone, before being found months later, almost perfectly preserved.
    - The Narrator, who you may or not play as, has isolated himself on an island, writing the letters to his dead wife that you hear, and possibly coating the land with neon paint.
    - Many characters may or may not be others
- Various recurrent themes and images - to list them all would be pointless but here are some. The density of ideas for such a short and barebones experience is impressive.
    - from commentary: drew on history, stuff like white chalk lines could not be made up
    - illness and infection - Donnelly and Jacobson died as such, and the Narrator is succumbing, perhaps to a injury from a fall, perhaps to kidney stones, perhaps something less concrete
    - obsession and grief - related to infection
        - "The infection is not simply of the flesh."
    - hermitage and isolation - the legendary hermit of course, and the various characters who isolated themselves on the island, but also Paul's turning away from friends and family after the crash
    - parallel lines carved into the chalk of the island's cliffs - a sign to stay away
    - stones - Jacobson turned to a stone, the Narrator suffered (suffers?) from kidney stones
    - chemicals - including alcohol, but also medications and painkillers
    - the Bible - notably Lot's wife and Paul the Apostle's conversion in Damascus
    - the sea - as a barrier to the world, the creatures within as... what?
        - the underwater hallucination
    - radio and the tower? ascending the peak?
    - bird?
- Writing style reminiscent of Romanticism
    - focus on personal emotions, the power of mystery of nature, and drawing connections between them
    - overwrought, flowery language
    - this is a positive for me, though I know it may not be for others
- "Psychogeography"
    - from commentary: no video games are real places, so why not lean into the artistic potential of unreality?
    - The island itself is the primary character

## the success and failures
- main success: conveying a concept of a cycle of loss, regret, and self-destruction, across time and people
- secondary success: allowing players to consider the soft possibilities of the narrative (who was driving?)
- main failure: it isn't paced particularly well, threads are established and dropped literally randomly

- Failures of the randomized story telling experiment
    - threads are established, and then lost
    - notably for me: circuit diagrams, Esther's birth circumstances
    - and even when a connection is made, the meaning is dim. So yes, I heard something similar before, and? What else?

- Poor pacing
    - walkspeed!
    - lack of consistency in when narration triggers, must traverse every inch - I only missed one, but still
    - bad pairing of visuals and narration on occasion, especially towards the end - determining the scrawled writing while an English man wails
    - the ending sucks - only time control is ripped away, it won't even let you kill yourself

- Brevity saves it
    - still to long to replay comfortably - unlike Dr. Langeskov for instance
    - maybe that's fine, expectation that you will run to google search unknown words or phrases and look up the entire script anyways

- conclusion: an interesting concept, but feels inherently limited - the randomization of the story is the least interesting part? More of a distraction...

## Dear Esther as the ur-walking sim

Possibly more interesting than what the story is conveying is the method by which it is conveyed

- Context of it's release - an exercise in simplification and reduction, released in a time of first person shooters
    - Call of Duty 4 (2007), surrounded by others chasing that success [Medal of Honor, Battlefield]
    - Halo 3 (2007), Gears of War (2006)
    - Resistance: Fall of Man, and Killzone showed PlayStation trying to occupy that space
    - Fallout 3 (2008), series shifting into first person
    - Hell, even Metroid Prime 3 (2007)
    - Valve games, Half-Life 2, TF2, Left 4 Dead, all released within the past year
- directly inspired by similar games
    - commentary namechecks DOOM, System Shock, STALKER, and HL2 naturally
- asks, what else can we do with these tools?
    - somewhat preempted by Portal (2007)
    - possibly preceded by graphic adventure games told from a first-person perspective, like Myst
    - but stripped even further, of any puzzle elements
- focus on conveying an emotion above all else, through environment and sound almost purely
- It's development into the form from the primitive original mod - differences
    - Surprisingly similar to the remake, all the ideas are there
        - Overall a bit shorter - about an hour, versus 90min remake, shorter route, with fewer narration points
        - The writing and narration is practically identical
        - The music is less emotive, but has the same compositions
        - The overall map layout is the nearly the same, with 4 general zones, just shorter
        - Details like the surprise bird at the bothy remain
        - the yonic passage through the caves
        - Even the fall into water into a hallucination is partially there
    - Many differences are strict improvements
        - The visuals are drastically different of course - Simpler and more polygonal, with messy textures at points
        - rerecorded music - Jessica Curry, music director, did the music with instrument samples and her own voice
            - got to record with live players
        - the physics objects behave erratically
        - the sound mixing is way off at points
        - unclear boundaries, and death leads to a full restart
        - other bugs, with getting stuc on terrain, reloading areas, and the ghost figures not disappearing - basically, all the signs of an amateur production
- but also what the remake lost along the way? Just a little
    - A more oppressive atmosphere is lost by streamlining the mechanics
        - Barren land with tall trees and rocks towering over you
        - The soundscape is harsher - whispers surround you at points, the music is louder, the staticy signals are more aggressive
        - Path is less obvious in where it is trying to lead you, I found myself walking into many dead ends
        - Clunky movement is almost a benefit at points?
            - You have to crouch manually to get through parts of the cave - less accessible, but conveys the clautrophobia better
            - You can fall off ledges - hurts the pacing, but makes navigation more involving?
        - I found myself checking my back frequently, and watching my step
    - The dividing of the experience into seperate chapters
        - perhaps necessary for technical reasons, but it feels like a downgrade
        - There are loading points in the mod, exactly where the chapter breaks are, but they are quick - the island is a continuous space in the mod and feels more geographically plausible as a result
    - Relatedly, also the addition of the hallucination beneath the water
        - I may prefer the original in this regard
        - The hallucination is visually striking and deeply melancholic
        - but the simplicity of the chunks of car beneath the water conveys similar ideas in a more natural, and shocking way

- Reception? Awards? Legacy?
