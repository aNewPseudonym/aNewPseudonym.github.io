Inspired in part by Matthewmatosis's video on Dear Esther and Journey []

## Dear Esther.

What is it
    - made by The Chinese Room
    - 2008 Half-Life 2 mod
    - remade for release in 2012
    - rereleased again as a Unity engine game in 2017 - this is the version I played.

How it plays


What I understood of the plot through my playthrough
    - There are 4 named characters: Esther, of course, Paul, Donnelly, and Jacobson
    - There is also the Narrator, who may be one of the named characters, specifically Paul.
    - Esther is the deceased wife of the Narrator, who died in a car crash. We get scant few details on her, beyond the nature of her death and the circumstances of her birth.
    - Paul was the driver of one of the cars involved in the accident, perhaps the one Esther was in, or perhaps the other. Whether he had or had not been drinking alcohol the night of the accident is lingering question in the mind of the Narrator.
    - Donnelly was the writer from the 1700s that visited the island on which the game takes place. In his book "A Hebridean History," he wrote on its inhabitants, miserable god-fearing sheperds mostly, as well as tales of an old hermit, and also Jacobson.
    - Jacobson was one of the first settlers of the island. He built a 'bothy' on the island, hoping to acquire enough land and good-standing to marry. He died only 2 years after completing it, from some illness. In his dying hours, he attempted to scale the island's cliff. His body froze, referred to as turning to a stone, before being found months later.
    - The Narrator, who you may or not play as, has isolated himself on an island, writing the letters to his dead wife that you hear, and possibly coating the land with neon paint.
    - Many characters may or may not be others

Various recurrent themes and images
    - illness and infection - Donnelly and Jacobson died as such, and Narrator is succumbing
    - obsession and grief - related to infection, "beyond the flesh"
    - hermitage and isolation - the legendary hermit of course, and the various characters who isolated themselves on the island, but also Paul's turning away from friends and family after the crash
    - parallel lines carved into the chalk of the island's cliffs - a sign to stay away
    - stones - Jacobson turned to a stone, the Narrator suffered (suffers?) from kidney stones
    - chemicals - including alcohol, but also medications and painkillers
    - the Bible - notably Lot's wife and Paul the Apostle's conversion in Damascus
    - the sea - as a barrier to the world, the creatures within as... what?
        - the underwater hallucination
    - radio and the tower? ascending the peak?
    - bird?

Ambiguity is the point
    - several words are repeated in different contexts, allowing you to draw connections and piece together a story

Writing style reminiscent of Romanticism
    - focus on personal emotions, the power of mystery of nature, and drawing connections between them
    - overwrought, flowery language
    - this is a positive for me, though I know it may not be for others

Visuals
    - major highlight, consistenly impressive tableaus
    - caves are a highlight, as are the expansive views of the sea, the framing of the radio tower, the caves
    - only a handful of lackluster visuals - the gems, some parts of the ground, the occasional chunky rock
    - best moments are when you are moving through a stunning environment and the Narrator's words feel deeply impassioned and you make a small connection between some part from before and something you know now.

Failures of the randomized story telling experiment
    - threads are established, and then lost
    - notably for me: circuit diagrams, Esther's birth circumstances
    - and even when a connection is made, the meaning is dim. Yes, I heard something similar before, and? Yes, the Narrator draws connections between himself

Poor pacing
    - walkspeed!
    - lack of consistency in when narration triggers, must traverse every inch - I only missed one, but still
    - bad pairing of visuals and narration on occasion, especially towards the end - determining the scrawled writing while an English man wails
    - the ending sucks - only time control is ripped away, it won't even let you kill yourself

Briefness saves it
    - still to long to replay comfortably - unlike Dr. Langeskov for instance
    - maybe that's fine, expectation that you will run to google search unknown words or phrases and look up the entire script anyways

## Tacoma.

The sure, steady hand of the designer comforted me. And made me complacent?

## Comparisons.

Differing origins points - Source Engine games vs. immersive sim Shock games

Similar gameplay, if not the same goals - piecing together a narrative, though the outcome is not deterministic in Dear Esther
    - in Dear Esther your interpretation is your own, and it cannot be wrond
    - in Tacoma, there is a factual description of what happened, and when you finish it is question of how complete your understanding is
