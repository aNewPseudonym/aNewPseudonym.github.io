Landmark Edition - Director's Commentary - Notes

Dan Pinchbeck - creative designer and writer
Jessica Curry - music director
Robert Briscoe - level designer and artist

Aiming high with visual goals
    randomized elements

Randomization and replay differences were an important goals

Music originally composed for samples, rerecorded with live players

The game is a "dream" - the music, landscape, and words meant to convey dreamline state

"Dreamlike words" - actively moving away from the directness/literalness of videogame worlds

Does have a gameplay loop! Bursts of engagement, each one targeting an overall mood
    akin to Halo

Subliminal symbols around environment
    Many changes from original
    Many hidden objects to reward player exploration

Hebridean island as setting
    island provides natural level constraints
    drew on history - stuff like white chalk lines could not be made up
    stark, depressing landscape very evocative

Designed level with irl clay?

Music evolves over play - changes, amplifies, breaks down

"Psychogeography"
    no video games are real places, so why not lean into the artistic potential of unreality

Major visual upgrade in remakes

Title taken from "Faith No More" song "The Crab Song"
    sounded evocative, built plot from that

Didn't set out to write a plot, more just assembling a variety of compelling things

Lots of time to think - music and voiceover is not over present

The island is the primary character

The 1st walking sim!
    Walking speed and minimalism did not seem revolutionary to developers at the time
    Quiet moments existed in many other games

Music director (name?) had never worked on a game before

Radio tower as a guide and beacon for players - akin to HL2 Citadel

3 narrative options per moment, 4 for remakes

Randomization opened up undesigned story possibilities to developers
    Ultrasound picture surprised a dev in a playthrough

Aesthetic was aiming for photorealism, but not fully impressionistic
    somewhere inbetween?

Influences - DOOM, System Shock, STALKER

Intentionally eschewing players ability to understand island as a real place, things that don't make sense

Hallucination of road in caves - new to remake
    a dream within a dream, going deeper and deeper
    heartbeat audio
    usually a car, could be a gurney

Journey through the caves as a kind of rebirth
    Voice singing "always, always, never"

Music hidden elements - morse code spelling Esther

Players' interpretation of the story just as important as the designers
    Who was responsible for the crash?
    Paul? Unintended possibilities

Struggled with describing the game upon initial release
    Have accepted "walking sim" as a genre definition term, has a recognizable identity now

Walking sims are simple but far from lazy

Disagreement among devs about losing control in the finale
    necessity with timing music and such...
