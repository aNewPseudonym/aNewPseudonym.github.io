## The Unfinished Swan

# Intro

"Monroe's mother had always been much better at starting things than finishing them. When she died, she left behind over 300 canvases, not one of them finished. Along with Monroe, who felt pretty unfinished himself. The orphanage allowed him to keep only one painting. And so he chose the unfinished swan that had always been his mother's favorite. But that night he woke up to find the swan had disappeared. So he ook his mother's silver paintbrush, and followed the footprints into a little door he hadn't seen before."

And so begins *The Unfinished Swan*, a delightful freshman effort from the studio Giant Sparrow. In it, you play as Monroe, the recently orphaned young boy, as he journeys through a series of strange lands, chasing after the titular unfinished swan that escaped from his mother's painting. The gameplay is effectively a series of navigation puzzles. The game is broken into chapters, each featuring a different sort of disorienting environment that must be traversed with the aid of throwing liquid using Monroe's mother's paint brush.

Each of the 3 main chapters, plus the short epilogue, feature a different set of mechanics and play quite differently.

# The Garden

The first chapter asks you to traverse a pure white environment with the aid of black ink blobs you can throw to reveal surfaces. There is something inherently exciting about staring into a blank screen, totally disoriented, before chucking an ink ball to reveal an unexpected object that was there the whole time. The game creates a natural series of buildup and reveals, simply by laying out the environment in smart ways. Because the environmental design is critical - if the player were asked to simply traverse a rectilinear maze, the game would quickly become tedious. Indeed, the developers show their knowledge of that fact in the level, suggesting that the player may have to traverse an extended labyrinth, before providing a shortcut to the end.

The mechanics simply provide the framework for buildups and reveals, and the developers use that to provide many clever environmental surprises to uncover. When chucking an ink ball, you may uncover a creature, that runs away startled. You may reveal a funny statue, a swinging crate, or a body of water inhabited by a sea monster. The world is a joy to discover, filled with a surprising humor and life. The developers smartly use sightlines and perspective tricks to guide the player and create more fun reveals. The occasional golden object, like the titular swan's footprints and other visual highlights, sharply contrast against the white environment and beckon the player in the proper direction. The game also provides many instances where you can look back upon areas you have traversed. This keeps you oriented, and creates a curious joy of being able to trace your path through a level that earlier was nothing but a blank slate. And the game constantly tries to confound your expectations, like allowing you to fall into an unseen hole, or blocking your progress with a hidden gate.

The game knows when to mix things up. The game progresses through increasingly complex spaces of pure white, before transitioning to areas with some shadows. The challenge shifts subtly; an area may look normal from one direction with shadows that clearly define the objects in the environment, but traversing to another angle leaves you in disorienting white again. The change also allows for the developers to create more visual splendor with vast environments. Walking out a doorway or up a set of stairs can reveal a towering castle, or giant labyrinth.

There is also a simple, base thrill to covering a clean environment in dirty ink. Whirling around, throwing a dozen ink balls and watching them find targets in a satisfying *splotch* is great. 

Learning in pieces about the silly, mustachioed King that created this sterile, white land only adds to the fun.

Via storybook-style murals around the environment, you learn the story of the King that created this strange land. This is one of the final great tricks of the game, contextualizing the abstract game world with a charming tale in the style of a child's storybook. A talented and headstrong artist, the King created his kingdom in pure white, thinking no color was good enough for his creation. But as more people arrived in his kingdom, and their complaints about the confusing white land grew, he was forced to compromise his vision by adding shadows. Eventually, the King gave up on this kingdom and the demands of the people who inhabited it, leaving it behind, unfinished, as he went to establish a new kingdom.

The first chapter feels like the most polished section of the game. The unlockable demo level, accessible to players upon collecting all of the balloons in the game, shows the ink throwing mechanics realized in an early phase of development basically unchanged from the final product. This was clearly the main idea driving the creation of the game, and the developers explore so many ideas with the game in a short amount of time. The pacing is perfect, and the reveals and visual humor are clever and abundant. The hour or so it takes to play through it is sublime. 

The only criticism I have would be the use of portals. At two points in the chapter, the game uses spatial distortion. It is first set up in a room where two doors on opposite walls are impossibly linked together, creating a infinte chain of identical rooms, impossible to escape. The puzzle is to understand that a hole in the floor is also linked to the open ceiling, allowing you to fall to an otherwise inaccessible elevated platform to progress. This is the only point in the chapter that this mechanic is used for a puzzle. Unlike the the ink throwing mechanic, which is explained in the story as Monroe using his mother's paintbrush, or the strange look of the world, explained as the visual preference of the odd King, these portals are not contextualized within the narrative. Its lack of explanation and very brief usage in the game leaves it feeling half-baked and underutilized. However, the moment when the mechanic returns is such a great payoff that I have to forgive it. As you begin to traverse a giant labyrinth and the immensity of it really sets in, a gate you pass through transports you to a castle in the far distance. Walking through the gate and looking back over the labryinth you were just in is so striking and memorable that the portal mechanic deserves inclusion for that alone. I only wish the mechanic saw better integration at other points in the game.

The first chapter had me fall in love instantly with this game. It is a masterclass in environmental storytelling. Sadly, the rest of the game is not nearly as tightly designed as the first chapter.

# The Unfinished Empire

THe second chapter begins strong. Monroe is in a new kingdom, and the new artstyle that accompanies it is gorgeous. Black objects sit upon white backgrounds, and pops of gold and light blue accentuate key elements. A sleeping giant lays just beyond a wall, his giant toes capable of being tickled. His breakfast, a giant slice of toast rests on a nearby building.

Mechanically, Monroe now throws balls of water which paint a light blue mark on surfaces but quickly evaporate, contextualized by Monroe having fallen into a sea at the start of the chapter. The early parts of this level could feel like a regression as a result, or at least an abrupt shift. The only new gameplay mechanic to engage with is throwing water blobs at clearly marked red turnstiles to interact with certain objects, like lowering a bridge. It doesn't really leverage the game's unique mechanics, as it is functionally no different than pressing a button to activate a device, a gameplay pattern found in a myriad of other games. The game is still clever though. A fun moment comes when you find a dammed-up, empty water canal that you must jump into. Here, there are no shadows or other colors, maintaining the idea that such things only exist if the King intentionally painted them in, which he couldn't do under the water. You must then use the temporary stains of the water blobs to guide you through the pure white canal, to a place where you can rise out and open the dam, thus raising a boat and allowing you to continue forward. 

The problem is that early sections of the level are brief and disconnected from each other. At one point, you walk through a deeply shadowed area, and again must use the water stains to guide you. Then you must ascend a structure of scaffolding, using water balls occasionally to interact with mechanical elements to further your progress. Then you must find a path to another red lever to open another dam. Each of these segments are brief, shallow, and fail to create a cohesive gameplay identity for this section. Where the first chapter steadily built upon the unique ink throwing mechanic in clever ways, the early segments of the second chapter feel disjointed, fine ideas in isolation but not building upon each other in any interesting ways.

The game finally finds itself again by introducing the vines. The vines are brilliant. By throwing water onto a surface, vines will wildly race towards that spot. The more water you throw, the more the vines will spread, covering more surface area and spawning more vines. You can climb on the vines up vertical surfaces, allowing you to create pathways for yourself around the environment. This is a perfect extension of the core ideas of the ink throwing mechanic. Both are used to provide a freeform and expressive way of creating a path through an environment. Both are used to create visual surprises and humor - the ink by uncovering unexpected objects, and the vines by periodically providing objects like trellises or topiary structures that animate when covered in vines. They leave permanent marks on the landscape, allowing you look back on your route through the level and see your progression, a fact leveraged by level design that provides many viewpoints to look back on your path. And they both connect thematically to the story of the overzealous King, by providing ways to disrupt his carefully sculpted kingdom. 

Similar to the gameplay, the story is also a bit meandering in the early sections, before also finding it's focus. The opening cutscene and initial area establishes a lazy, sleeping giant as a focal point, the only remaining resident of this kingdom. But the giant is soon forgotten. It feels like a loose plot thread, one that deserved a payoff, however small, at some point. The story regains its footing again as it recounts how, again, the King struggled to meet the demands of his subjects. He was forced to build a sewage system and then a canal system to satisfy his subjects. But then the canal brought a horde of vines, the ones that comprise the main gameplay of the chapter. THe vines were a wild element beyond the control of the King, one that his unruly subjects secretly helped to flourish. In anger and desperation, the King created a terrible creature to combat the vines. Naturally, the create was beyond his control, and he was only barely able to force it into the sea. This chapter also introduces the internal motivation of the King - his desire to leave behind a permanent legacy, inspired by the destruction of his sand castle by the waves when he was just a boy. The story begins to humanize the King more, which will reach a climax in the final chapter.

The apotheosis of the chapter comes when you enter the King's chambers, another pure white space like the first chapter, fitting his personal preference. Here, the vines now allow you to uncover the contours of the environment. Covering a sterile white space in leafy growth to find a path through is just as satisfying as splattering black ink. Nearly as fun is when you are given a firehose to spray water at a great distance, allowing you to coat whole buildings in vines and trace a path across a great gap.

Despite the genius of the vine mechanics, the chapter doesn't quite leverage them in the same way the first chapter did with its ink mechanics. The ink was a constant in the chapter, a thing you had to use nearly constantly as you explored. The vines not only take a while to be introduced, they also are periodically taken away from you afterwards, and also given strict limitations. Cracks in the environment cannot be crossed with vines, creating set areas in which you can explore. This was an unavoidable limitation, given the size of the environments the developers crafted. Making all of it freely explorable via the vines would be confusing to players. Still, the limitations are strongly felt, and the simple freedom and genius of ink throwing is only reached at points in the second chapter. 

Despite my criticisms, the second chapter is still strong, and is suitable followup to the first. The lack of mechanical focus for its early part is made up by the incredible visual direction, and the vines, though somewhat underused, are a brilliant extension of the first chapters mechanics. Sadly, the third chapter fails to live up to either of the preceding chapters.

# Night Time

While the second chapter takes a while to find its focus, the third never does at all. It begins with a strong idea. Monroe finds himself if a dark, unsettling forest at night. The only way to orient yourself is to stare up at the stars above and use the silhouettes of the overhanging trees to provide a sense of spatial orientation. It's a good visual hook, and it feels faithful to the feeling of being in the wilderness on a dark night, away from the usual light of urban environments, where the stars and moon above are the brightest lights to be seen. It is even an idea that appeared, in a form, in the unlockable early demo level of the game (though it was accompanied by the ability to throw white ink in that version).

It is evident right from start that the mechanical focus is lacking by the the sort of liquid you throw. The black ink and then the blue water of the earlier chapters connected the story and the mechanics tightly. In the third chapter, its not even clear what you throw. It's black like ink, but evaporates like water. Most of the level has you traversing a nearly pitch black environment, so it doesn't reveal anything in the environment. On third replay, I suspect it may be intended to be black water, polluted by the terrible creature the King banished to the sea in the earlier chapter, but if it is, it is not made clear. The only mechanic it has is activating bioluminescent plants scattered in the environment upon contact. The lack of clarity is a small but telling sign that this chapter is undercooked.

Most of the chapter requires you to run between points of light for safety. Being in the dark inflicts damage on you by unseen monsters, which introduces something new to the game - a fail state. You could "die" in the first two chapters by falling into water, which simply placed you back on land where you fell. It was not a punishment for doing anything wrong, as platforming challenges were not the focus. It was simply a way reset the player and keep them within the bounds of the gameworld. But in the third chapter, you are expected to complete somewhat difficult challenges, the failure of which forces you to try again. This is a dramatic departure. Monroe being eaten by monsters, complete with with bite and claw marks and red tinting on the screen feels out of place in the otherwise light-hearted, storybook nature of the game. It is also simply not fun. Activating lights and running between their spheres of protecting is fine. Seeing lights in the distance, obscured by trees, tie back to the use of guiding sightlines in earlier levels. It's very simple, and lacks the freeform nature of the ink or the vines, but it works.

But soon a light orb is introduced. It is a physics object in the world that emits light, and you must guide it using your body and your liquid blobs. This is a very frustrating mechanic, because the orb is difficult to guide and behaves erratically with you and environment. At one point, the orb got caught between my avatar's body and a piece of the environment, leading the ball to skyrocket into the air, leaving me in the dark where I got eaten by monsters. At two points, you have to run to keep up with the ball, once as it rolls down a hill, and at another when it floats down a river. This introduces an element of time pressure that also has not existed up to this point, which leads to frustration when you fail to keep up, get eatem and must retry from the beginning.

It doesn't help that this segment lacks much of the visual charm of previous areas. The dark shading on many of the objects looks poorly done compared to the clean look of the first two chapters. And many surfaces have textures that are simply at too low a resolution. Worse, the game actually takes some bad frame drops in this section. The game previously felt defined by clean visuals, and charming tone, and a calm, slow pace of gameplay. Now, you have muddy visuals, a dark sinister tone, and hurried gameplay filled with fail states. It feels terrible, and the frame rate drops make it even more frustrating.

Mercifully, this mechanic transitions into something else. The focus becomes about entering portals into a blueprint world in which you can create rectangular blocks by designating points on surfaces. The game asks you to create steps and bridges to traverse the world, and occasionally create blocks that manifest back in the real world that allow to progress. It's an ok mechanical idea, but it feels awkward and limited. You are creating pathways, similar to the vines, but the creating properly sized blocks is somewhat slow and awkward. The platforming in the game is floaty and imprecise, and these segments ask you to do more of it than any other part of the game. It is recalls some of the ideas of the earlier segments - looking back the stacks of blocks you made to traverse the level recalls earlier segments, and creating objects in the manner the King might have done is in contrast to you ruining his creations in earlier levels. But the clunkiness, as well as the lack of visual interest in these levels, fail to make a strong impact.

The chapter ends with a dud. You must ascend the giant statue of the King you have been moving towards the whole chapter. Again, a time sensitive challenge is presented, in which you must climb to the top as water rises around you. This happens in total darkness, with no way to illuminate your surroundings. The solution is nothing more than trial and error. Thankfully, the segment is short, and I completed it in a handful of quick attempts, but it is totally unsatisfying. As culmination of the chapter, it does not build upon any of the existing mechanics.

Despite this chapter's gameplay being a mess, the story moves towards a powerful conclusion. The King, exhausted by the failures of his previous kingdoms, decides to move to an island and create himself a family instead, beginning with a house. Then he created himself a wife, strongly implied to be Monroe's mother, revealing the King to be Monroe's father. The King did everything he could to make his Queen happy creating and recreating rooms of their house, and showering her with gifts. She was uninterested in it all, though the King was to oblivious to notice. The Queen eventually got pregnant, and left shortly before she was to give birth. This threw the King into a terrible state of depression in which he could not paint for years. Despite the many issues with this chapter, wandering through the dark abandoned house of the King and Queen, still unfinished, is one of the most poignant parts of the game. The portraits and unfinished paintings on the wall, along the unused nursery items, creating a quietly sad and touching scene.

If the first chapter had a strong, consistent mechanical focus, and the second merely took a while to find it's focus, the third has only a handful of unfinished ideas. None of the mechanics feel strong enough to sustain interest over a whole level, which may be why the developers felt the need to split their focus. Manuevering in a dark forest could have sustained a whole level, but the muddiness of the visuals and frustration of controlling the light orb kill this segment. The blueprint world doesn't seem to have the depth to create interesting interactions for a whole level, which is perhaps why it is confined to roughly a third of one chapter. The worst part of this chapter is that the developers have not found any way to entwine the level design with visual surprises and humor, perhaps the most endearing part of the early chapters. There are no surprises to be found in illuminating the forest, nor objects of interest to be created within the blueprint world. The simple yet frustrating gameplay mechanics are nearly all that is to be found.

# The King's Dream

Thankfully, the game still ends strong. The King's Dream epilogue serves a capstone to the game, narratively and thematically, as well as for the gameplay, as it revisits all the ideas of all the previous levels. It's joyous ending, as you revisit locations and mechanics as the music swells and the credits roll. It is a strong note to end on. It allows the weak link that is the third chapter to be a dip in quality that picks up again for the finale, instead of a sour note to end on.

In the narrative, the King resolved to create a giant statue of himself, a monument to his ego meant to last for ages, but this too he could never finish. He got trapped, literally, in his dream, for that too he was unable to finish. This is where Monroe finds him, sitting by a fire, alone but for his pet hippo, sleeping up until the moment Monroe arrives. The King recounts his dream, having seen in it his life's work ruined, by Monroe's destruction and the ravages of time. He witnesses his own death and the destruction of the universe, and realizes how all he had done would eventually disappear. He comes to terms with it, accepting all he built and did not finish, and remembering the joy he had in creating it regardless. The King hands Monroe his own paintbrush, hopes that you will be a better man than him, and ushers you away back to your room.

That night, before going to bed, Monroe paints a complete swan.

# Theming
    - Artistic creation, finishing works
    - Fixing the mistakes of the parent
    - Designing or correcting your work to accomodate others and unexpected changes
    - Videogame meta-commentary

The game's story is told in the manner of a fairytale or child's storybook, but there are several themes to tap into that contextualize the act of playing the game. The most evident and persistent in the game is the struggles of artistic creation. Monroe's mother could never finish her paintings and the all of the King's works in all the lands you explore are left incomplete. It's not clear why Monroe's mother also struggle to complete her art, but she was made by the King in his own image, so she likely inherited all his struggles. For the King, his works are incomplete for a variety of reasons - his work is unable to be appreciated by others without being runined (as with his pure white areas), he gets frustrated with the demands of his subjects and abandons them (as with the first kingdom), he no longer wishes to go through the work of maintaining them (as with the vine-infested kingdom), or he loses his creative energy (as with his giant statue). All his work is incomplete or ruined, and you as the player bring about much of its ruination. The player, as Monroe, can be viewed as the agent of destruction in the King's lands, splattering ink and spreading vines over his creations. Throughout the game, the King bemoans the destruction of his work, but his realization by the end is that all the artistic creation, regardless of its state of completion of its longevity, was still worth it. He enjoyed the process itself, even if his work and legacy is inevitably doomed to be destroyed.

But Monroe could also be viewed as completing the King's work. The pure white lands of the first chapter were confusing to the King's subjects, and by traversing them and covering them in black splatters, Monroe makes them legible and capable of being appreciated. It's the same in the kingdom of the second chapter, which were beautiful but lifeless and difficult to traverse. By covering them in vines, Monroe makes them more beautiful, and returns life to the abandoned city. This connects the first two chapters to the third, in which Monroe enters the King's blueprint world, and helps to finish the King and Queen's abandoned house. (Note: This compounds my frustration with the light orb mechanic in the dark forest, which does not adhere to this thematic reading of the game.)

From this perspective, Monroe is fixing the mistakes of his parents, and finding his own complete identity by reconciling their works. Throughout the game, Monroe is chasing the unfinished swan, which is leading him towards his father. Monroe uses his mother's paintbrush to move through the King's lands, leaving his own marks upon them and completing them. By playing through the game, you are unifying the the mother and father, creating something whole in the process. The theme comes full circle in the end, when Monroe recieves the King's paintbrush, which he then uses to create a complete painting of the mother's favorite work, the swan. Again, the father and mother combine through Monroe to produce something that is whole. As the new generation of artist, Monroe takes what worked about the previous generation and combines them to create something better and more complete. The passage of time destroys the old, but the new grows out of its ruins.

A brief tangent: I also picked up on some videogame metacommentary in this game. It crossed my mind when in the finale, the King acknowledges the credits and subtitles. The succession of the kingdoms can be interpreted as the development of a game. First, there is only untextured, unlit geometry. Lighting and shadows are added, and then eventually color. Enemies are added too. The King is developer, and his reluctant compromises to his subjects are akin to making gameplay compromises for players. Monroe is literally the player, and his destructive gameplay mechanics represent the unexpected ways that players will interact with and respond to game once it is released. The analogy works, and that's also because the themes of the game could be applied to almost any artistic field. The struggles of creation are universal.

# Is this a Walking Sim?

    - limited mechanical depth or puzzle complexity, emphasis on exploring a narrative through environmental storytelling

# Conclusion

There are so many details to love in this game. The storybook introductions to each level, and the way they smoothly transition into gameplay, the honking of the swan and its goofy waddle as you chase it around, the audio expressions Monroe makes in response to parts of the game. The 2D art is lovely, and the soundtrack perfectly matches the storybook tone. So much of the game is lovingly crafted, and that makes it frustrating when the game loses its focus, particularly in the third chapter. Despite its shortcomings, its an easy game to love, and its short length make a joy to replay.
